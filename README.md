Exploring Frequency Modulation Synthesis in Pure Data

## Intro
This Pure Data Project features 4 Instruments, Brass, Clarinet, Plastic Drum
and Ghost. By manipulating and maintaining *carrier* and *modulation*
frequency relationships, controlling an index of modulation for
amplitudes, as well as velocity envelopes for different notes, we can
control the presence of harmonic overtones, thus creating
difference timbres and sonic qualities for different instruments.
